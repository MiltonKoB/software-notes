## Agotron detection

The following is according to https://github.com/ncrnalab/agotron_detector as described in
> Hansen TB (2018). Detecting Agotrons in Ago CLIPseq Data. in Vang Ã˜rom UA (ed) miRNA Biogenesis-Methods and Protocols, Chapter 17, 221-232. Springer.
```bash
wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/chromFa.tar.gz

    samtools index $i.sort.bam

```
Note that it is easier to implement with ```prefetch``` as shown below.

## SNP discovery

The following reference discribes several pipelines for SNP discovery.

## sra-toolkit, tophat

These are very straightforward, e.g.,
```bash
prefetch -v SRR3534842
fastq-dump --split-files --gzip SRR3534842
```
the SRR3534842.sra from prefetch is actually at $HOME/ncbi/public/sra which is split into `SRR3534842_1.fastq.gz`, `SRR3534842_2.fastq.gz` at the current directory. See https://www.biostars.org/p/111040/. However, the location may not desirable since it may create a huge .vdi files with VirtualBox -- to get around we do this
```bash
cd $HOME
mkdir -p /home/jhz22/D/work/ncbi/public/sra
ln -sf /home/jhz22/D/work/ncbi
```
where D is actually a shared folder at Windows.

To run ```tophat```, see https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/tutorial.shtml
```bash
wget https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/downloads/test_data.tar.gz
tar xvfz test_data.tar.gz
cd test_data
tophat -r 20 test_ref reads_1.fq reads_2.fq
```

# Software

## ANGSD

ANGSD is a software for analyzing next generation sequencing data, http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD. It is relatively straightforward with GitHub; after
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd
cd angsd
make
```
but the following change is needed on line 468 of `misc/msHOT2glf.c`: `tmppch` as in (tmppch=='\0') should be `*tmppch` as in `(*tmppch==''0')`, suggested by the compiler.

## bamtools, bcftools, bedtools, blast (ncbi-blast+), fastqc, fastx-toolkit, hmmer, hisat2, picard-tools, sambamba, samtools, seqtk, sra-toolkit, tophat, vcftools

Install with ```sudo apt install```.

See also https://github.com/lh3/seqtk.

## cutadapt, TrimGalore

A prerequesite is to install cython.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt
cd cutadapt
sudo python setup.py install
git clone https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore
```

## fastx_toolkit

It is also available from https://github.com/agordon/fastx_toolkit along with https://github.com/agordon/libgtextutils, and do away with the notorious automake-1.14 problem associated with sources at http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/download.html.

However, line 105 of ```src/fasta_formatter/fasta_formatter.cpp``` requires ```usage()``` followed by ```exit(0);``` as suggested in the `issue` section. More oever, usage() is a void function so its own `exit(0)` is unnecessary.

## hisat2, sambamba, picard-tools, StringTie

This may somewhat be overlapped with ```apt install``` above,
```bash
brew tap brewsci/bio
brew tap brewsci/science
brew install hisat2
hisat2-build
brew install sambamba
brew install picard-tools
brew install stringtie
```
It could be useful with ``brew reinstall```. See
> Raghavachari N, Garcia-Reyero N (eds.) (2018), Gene Expression Analysis-Methods and Protocols, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493978335, Chapter 15, Springer.

Nevertheless it may be slower, e.g., tophat, compared to ```sudo apt install```.
