**Software notes for association studies**

This repository collects information dynamically on software

1. [Overall setup](overall)
2. [Association analysis](association.md)
3. [Sequence analysis](seq.md)
4. [Machine learning](ML.md)
5. [AI](AI.md)
6. [Miscellaneous software](misc.md)

when it becomes lengthy the notes will be kept in specific directories.

It is expected that the site could eventually be enriched by many practitioners.
