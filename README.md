**Setup of software in several categories**

1. [System environments](envirs)
2. [Association analysis](AA.md)
3. [Next-generation sequence analysis](NGS.md)
4. [Miscellaneous software](misc.md)
5. [Statistical learning](SL.md)
6. [Artificial intelligence](AI.md)

Although there are many possibilities e.g., Anaconda and Linuxbrew, to get the pre-built executables up running, the bonus to start from the scratch is that we can always use the latest release as well as the test data. Of course, by doing so we could expand the list of software involved both locally and globally.

We have seen that the list of software from multiple sources will both be enriched and evolved over time.
