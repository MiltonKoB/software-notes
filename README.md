**Setup of software in several categories**

1. [System environments](envirs)
2. Genetic analysis
   * [Association analysis](AA.md)
   * [Next-generation sequence analysis](NGS.md)
   * [Miscellaneous software](misc.md)
3. [Statistical learning](SL.md)
4. [Artificial intelligence](AI.md)

While there are multiple sources (e.g., Linux archive, Anaconda and Linuxbrew) to get the pre-built executables up-running, they may work less well compared to those built from the latest source distributions.

With the later option we can always download the latest release, make minor changes, test the documentation example(s) and give feedback to the developers.
