# LDpred

Now it is rather simple to install, e.g.,
```bash
pip install ldpred
```
or
```bash
pip install --user ldpred
```
Nevertheless it is rather laborous to read through the documentation and we try the GitHub version as well.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bvilhjal/ldpred
cd ldpred
cd ldpred
python test.py
```
rather than a Bash version from scratch.
