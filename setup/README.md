# Setup

1. It is relevant to have knowledge about GNU parallel and sge or slurm (e.g., https://github.com/statgen/SLURM-examples); see also descriptions in other pipelines here.
Under Ubuntu, parallel is easily installed as follows,
```{bash}
sudo apt install parallel
```
2. Here is a section dedicated to [R and RStudio](R).
3. A broad coverage on genomewide association studies is available from [vdi.md](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/GDCT/blob/master/vdi.md) as part of the removed GWAS-2017 repository and now listed in [GDCT repository](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/GDCT).
