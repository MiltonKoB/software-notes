# Overall

## Parallel computing, R, and other software

1. It is relevant to have knowledge about GNU parallel and sge. Under Ubuntu, parallel is easily installed as follows,
```{bash}
sudo apt install parallel
```
see also descriptions in other pipelines here. It is perhaps more demanding with sge, e.g., https://peteris.rocks/blog/sun-grid-engine-installation-on-ubuntu-server/.
Example use of slurm can be seen from https://github.com/statgen/SLURM-examples.

2. Here is a section dedicated to [R and RStudio](../R).

3. A broad coverage on genomewide association studies is available from [vdi.md](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/GDCT/blob/master/vdi.md) as part of the removed GWAS-2017 repository and now listed in [GDCT repository](https://github.com/jinghuazhao/GDCT).
