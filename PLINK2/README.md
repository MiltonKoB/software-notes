## Issue with --make-grm-bin

The issue is to do with .grm.bin.N which is shorter than expected for GCTA.

However, there is no such problem with its --make-grm-list which allows for the possibility to use --mgrm-list option to combine chromosome-specific GRMs.

Note also the way to use individual's IDs in PLINK2.
