## Issue with --make-grm-bin

Both [PLINK 1.90beta](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/) and [PLINK 2.00 alpha](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/) have issue with .grm.bin.N which is shorter than expected for GCTA. The problem is insidious but would prevent chromosome-specific GRMs to be combined.

Nevertheless there is no such problem with its --make-grm-list which allows for the possibility to use --mgrm-list option to combine chromosome-specific GRMs.

Note also the way to use individual's IDs in PLINK2.
